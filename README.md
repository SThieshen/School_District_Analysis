# **School District Analysis**
## Project Overview

Within the school district analysis, data was provided that required collection, then had to be imported to create a DataFrame within pandas. The data then required preparation and cleaning, so it could be properly analyzed. Those steps included removing rows with missing values, any duplicate data, removing unnecessary labeling, finding the data types, and getting an overview shot of the data after completing those tasks. The next step was summarizing the overall data within the DataFrame and then finally, looking specifically at different row, columns, and subsets of data. The final task was comparing charter and public schools.

## Comparing Public and Charter schools

The final assigned task to complete with the data provided was analysis comparing public and charter schools within a district. Analysis focused on average math and reading scores, as well as comparing school budgets by type. After completing the analysis, data revealed charter schools demonstrated higher average scores in math and reading, while receiving less funds than public schools.
